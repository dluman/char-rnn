# char-rnn
A basic, single-layer character-level RNN based on Andrej Karpathy's "vanilla" minimal RNN. This is largely a class-based transcription of the 100-line gist provided here: https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086.

I am very intersted in making this code much better, even adapting it to a mutliple-layer RNN. While I will eventually have to go to a framework (like Tensorflow), I am interested in working framework-free for a while.
